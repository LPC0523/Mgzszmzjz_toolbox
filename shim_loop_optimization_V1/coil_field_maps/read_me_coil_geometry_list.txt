List of coil geometries included:

8ch encircling RF-shim loops

32ch helmet of RF-shim loops

39ch hybrid helmet design: 31 RF-shim loops with 8 additional 5-turn shim loops over the face.  Note that this array geometry is slightly different from the 32ch helmet

48ch helmet of RF-shim loops

48ch cylindrical 100-turn loops on cylindrical surface (see Juchem et al., JMR 2011)

64ch helmet of RF-shim loops

128ch helmet of RF-shim loops


All RF-shim loops are single-turn.


To regenerate the fields of any of these coils, run the script entitled “b1sim…” for the desired array size in the “generate_coil_field_maps” subfolder.  Make sure that the “biot_savart_solder_code” folder is in the Matlab path when running scripts.
